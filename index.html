            <p>Hello guys! I'm Taani Maama. Currently I am undergoing a transformation in my life of working on a career in the tech industry as I try to transition from a life of cooking and restaurant experience. I am very passionate towards web development and what you can do with the endless possibilities with it and I am very excited about the future not only for me but everyone in this line of work. While my coding journey has just started I know that my work will be very impressive and only getting better. Thanks for checking out my page and take a look around! </p>
